\begin{abstract}

Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a recently developed therapy for the prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The treatment is available as a pill named Truvada and is taken once a day for as much as 99\% protection from infection when exposed to HIV. While medically effective, PrEP suffers from high drug costs, HIV-related social stigma, and under-informed health providers and patients. This paper contributes a data mining and machine learning strategy that monitors Twitter social media data to determine HIV and PrEP discussion trends. Our results show that we can identify PrEP and HIV discussion dynamics over time, and positive and negative PrEP-related tweets. These results can be used by public health professionals to inform and protect at-risk individuals from HIV. 

%These methods may also be useful to identify and preempt HIV outbreaks before they reach epidemic levels.

\section{Results}



We sought to determine trends in HIV and PrEP discourse on twitter, to inform and coordinate public health efforts aiming to promote PrEP adoption and adherence for at-risk individuals. We collected 624,569 tweets containing at least one of the following words 'HIV', 'AIDS', 'truvada', 'prophylaxis', 'imtesting', 'PrEP' from Twitter's streaming API. The tweets were restricted to English language, and the collection dates spanned from the 47th week of 2015 to the 14th week of 2016. The tweets were and cleaned of exotic characters.

We excluded tweets that did not originate in contiguous United States time zones. A subset of the tweets we collected had geolocation data available. We found that tweets were largely concentrated on US and Canadian metro areas (Figure 1).

\subsection{Word and Document Similarity}

The first analysis that we performed sought to identify certain keywords, hashtags, tweets and users, that were discussed in HIV and PrEP related contexts. Word2Vec and the related method, Paragraph2Vec are unsupervised machine learning methods that have performed well at embedding natural language in a semantic vector space. In our analysis, Word2Vec allows us to determine semantically similar words to a query word, while Paragraph2Vec allows us to determine similar tweets, users and hashtags to a query hashtag.

We trained a Word2Vec model, and queried for the top 10 word-vectors related to the term PrEP (Table 1). We found several HIV related events, WorldAIDSDay, HLM2016AIDS, ICASA2015, as well as the PrEP drug Truvada, and the term HIV. In addition, we found the acronym ART which refers to Anti-Retroviral Therapy. DoingIt, and OneConversation, are ongoing efforts led by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to spread awareness and reduce the spread of HIV. NBHAAD is an organization that is committed to increasing awareness for HIV within the Black community (TODO: look up if there is some special connection between HIV and Black community). Nancy Reagan, who died in early 2016, was mentioned in conjunction with her efforts to combat HIV in the 1980's. Together these results show us a high-level view of the important components of the national PrEP conversation on Twitter.

% table 1 - w2v PrEP
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Cosine Similarity to word-vector 'PrEP'}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline

HIV & 0.692860\\ \hline
OneConversation & 0.688427\\ \hline
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Doc2Vec allows us to identify the top users, tweets, and hashtags associated with \#prep. Note that on Twitter, hashtags are not case sensitive. Querying for the top 10 document-level entities associated with \#prep, we again see several PrEP and HIV related hashtags including \#hiv, \#hivprevention, \#truvada, and \#whereisprep. We also see a LGBT-related hashtag, \#lgbtmedia16, which indicates a distinct awareness of PrEP in the Gay community. This may reflect the known levels of HIV transmission in gay men (TODO: cite something here).

Interestingly, we also found 3 tweets and 1 user in the top 10 doc2vec results for \#prep. Tweet 702179860983189504 has content spreading HIV prevention awareness: "\#StoneColdVideoTODAY if You see this 13 symptoms. Do HIV Test Immediately. Must Read". Conversely tweet 708519265540907010 has content that calls into doubt the usefulness of PrEP: "Checkout why PrEP is hurting the cause \& \#JoinTheConversation \#LGBTQIA". User 711275699529764864 is a twitter spam bot with no particular connection to PrEP. Together the Doc2Vec results show that we can monitor and identify PrEP-related hashtags and tweets. The most PrEP related tweets, the content of the above tweets were popular on twitter over the period of data that we collected. When they were retweeted, doc2vec weighted them more highly similar to \#prep. Thus with this method we demonstrate a way to identify and monitor the most viral tweets related to PrEP. As the discussion changes, public health professionals can use this information to quickly identify the most important viral sentiment in the online PrEP conversation.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Cosine Similarity to doc-vector '\#PrEP'}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline

\#harrogatehour & 0.628547 \\ \hline
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Finally we wanted to visualize the relative similarities of these PrEP-related keywords in a low dimensional space. We took several keywords that we had identified in our PrEP related queries, along with other HIV-prevention related terms, and visualised their word-vectors in 2 dimensions using tSNE (Figure 2)(TODO: citation for tSNE.).

We several trends. Notably the pharmaceutical based HIV therapies all cluster together (ART, PrEP, truvada), the AIDS awareness events cluster together (WorldAIDSDay, NBHAAD) and so do the sexually transmitted disease keywords (HIV, AIDS, STD). These results may provide another mechanism for researchers to visualize and identify relevant trends in PrEP-related keywords.

\centering
\includegraphics[height=4in, width=6in]{tSNE_word}
\caption{tSNE plot of relevant word-vectors}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Time Domain}

Next we sought to identify some temporal trends in PrEP related trends. We used Dynamic Topic Modelling (DTM) to identify how certain topics change over time. In DTM, documents are grouped in several corpuses that represent successive points in time. Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) is then performed on each corpus, to extract a topic distribution. The posterior topic distribution from time $t_n$ is used as the prior for time $t_{n+1}$. This lets the model determine a topic model for each time point that is dependent both on the set of tweets from that time point, and on the time point's document distribution. We specified 10 topics and used each week's worth of tweets, over a 30 week period from the 47th week of 2015 to the 14th week of 2016, as our time points.

We identified two topics that showed relevant trends. In topic 5 we see that the keyword 'PrEP' increases over time, while 'prevention', 'drug' and 'risk' remain constant (Figure 3). The term 'pill', also from topic 5, declines overtime. These dynamics may indicate that PrEP discussion is becoming more prevalent. Other HIV prevention related words such as 'pill', 'prevention' and 'drug' which serve as a form of negative controls. They are related to PrEP semantically, and are thus in the same topic. Yet the fact that they are not increasing, shows us that the increase in PrEP discussion is PrEP-specific.

However, it is hard to tell from these data though, whether the increased level of PrEP discussion is leading to increased levels of informed patients, medical providers, and adherence. It is possible that stigma, and misinformation is leading to greater levels of PrEP discussion on twitter. We will get more specific, granular understanding of the PrEP discourse in our sentiment analysis section below.

% figure 3
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2.5in, width=3.5in]{DTMfig1}
\caption{DTM topic 5 (PrEP related topic) word prevalence over time. Date is YYYY-WW.}
\end{figure}

We found at least one other DTM topic that showed interesting behaviour. We found that topic 4 captured several keywords related to World AIDS Day (Figure 4). We can see that 'WorldAIDSDay', and 'can' peak in the 47th week of 2015 and then decline into 2016. This correlates well with the actual date of World AIDS Day, December 1st. Furthermore, while December 1st is World AIDS day, the whole month of December is AIDS Awareness Month. We can clearly see the words 'raise' and 'awareness' peak later and last longer that the word 'WorldAIDSDay' implying that it is correlated to the whole month of December. While our PrEP investigation isn't specifically interested in World AIDS Day, or AIDS awareness month, this observation validates our ability to accurately identify temporal events using DTM. 

% figure 4
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=2.5in, width=3.5in]{DTMfig2}
\caption{DTM topic 4 (WorldAIDSDay related topic) word prevalence over time. Date is YYYY-WW.}
\end{figure}

Together, the DTM results demonstrate our ability to extract relevant HIV and PrEP related information from twitter that accurately captures time-dependant fluctuations. Public health professionals should be able to monitor these temporal trends to determine the relative interest in PrEP, and other HIV related keywords as they are discussed over time. This method could even lead to a system for early detection of HIV outbreaks, or other serious developments.

\subsection{User Timeline Analysis}

% Prior to topic modelling, tweets were cleaned of high and low frequency words, and transformed by Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) processing.

% TODO work this section (re download and re-run) Tuesday

We wanted to identify what Twitter users that mentioned PrEP were discussing in their other tweets. We identified users that were most similar to PrEP according to our Paragraph2Vec results, and downloaded their most recent 3000 tweets. We took the top 400 users that had at least 200 words in the combined tweets of their tweet history. For each user, we concatenated all of their tweets, and performed LDA topic modelling on the set of user-time line documents.

When we examine a clustermap of users vs. topics, we see that the majority of these users are discussing topics 5, 1, and 4 (Figure 5). When we look up the top words in the corresponding topic distributions, we see that topics 1 and 4 seem to be related to republican party politics.

% figure 5

\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}



Together these results suggest that PrEP users are involved in political discussions, and are internationally focused.



\subsection{Sentiment Classification}

% TODO work this section Tuesday (give example positive and negative tweets)

Lastly we trained a classifier to classify the sentiment of HIV and PrEP related tweets either positive or negative. This classifier would allow public health professionals to quickly identify positive and negative PrEP related tweets to guide HIV prevention efforts. We obtained a set of 1.6 million tweets with sentiment labels, either positive or negative from Sanders Analytics (http://www.sananalytics.com/lab/twitter-sentiment/). Then we trained a simple logistic regression classifier on 1.2 million paragraph-vectors from the sentiment dataset. We found that our classifier had an accuracy of 69\% using a portion of the sentiment tweets not used in training, as a validation set.

 We chose to use a relatively simple classifier model (logistic regression) and stop training at

We then used this classifier to classify our PrEP related tweets into positive or negative labels. We reported the most positive, and most negative tweets, by log(probability), on our full dataset, and on tweets that specifically mention either 'prep' or 'truvada' (Table 4).

\section{Conclusions}

- Moving towards HIV outbreak prediction. 

- Automatically identifying PrEP adoption/adherence sentiment in US population.

- A lot of information on twitter is from bots, they only cost \$ per bot. This along with the character limit and slang makes twitter hard to use, but we've shown that it can be used. In fact twitter bots are slowly making twitter unusable because free advertising and marketing. Maybe in a future project we make twitter bots to spread information about PrEP.
